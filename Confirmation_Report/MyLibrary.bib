abstract = {Coal samples in the form of randomly oriented aggregates were obtained from the Pennsylvania State University Coal Bank for the purpose of thermal conductivity measurements. Samples represented 55 locations from throughout the United States and included 6 lignites, 10 subbituminous coals, 36 bituminous coals, and 3 anthracite samples. Matrix thermal conductivities measured at 22°C in the laboratory ranged from 0.22 to 0.55 W/m°K, with an arithmetic mean of 0.33 W/m°K and a standard deviation of 0.07 W/m°K. The thermal conductivity of lignites, subbituminous, and bituminous coals is controlled by composition and can be predicted by a three-component (moisture, ash, and carbon + volatiles) geometric mean model with an rms residual of 6.1\%. The thermal conductivity of bituminous and anthracite samples was found to be positively correlated with matrix density. With the exception of three anthracite samples, rank was not correlated with thermal conductivity, nor was the ratio of carbon to volatiles. The relatively high thermal conductivity of three anthracite samples (mean of 0.49 W/m°K) may have been related to graphitization.},

The acquisition of reliable data and maps only started with the nationalization of the coal industry in 1947, hence most of shallow early workings are unknown and unmapped (Henton, 1974; Richardson, 1983).

In this paper, the use of low enthalpy geothermal energy that consists of converting mine galleries in underground heat exchangers is described and analysed. The system would be used in those areas with mining works that with a near future closure, such as Asturias but also other regions of Spain or Europe. The described system, unlike other proposed ones, implies to act before the closure of the mines, when it is possible to access underground galleries. A prediction method for evaluating the system capabilities has been developed which has been calibrated with measurements taken in underground mines and which can be used and calibrated in any mine in operation. Finally, using the method, the capabilities of a typical system are analysed and its viavility from a technical, economic and environmental point of view is proved."

For example, a single coal seam in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio contains 5.1 x 1012 L of water. The growing volume of water discharging from this one coal seam totals 380,000 L/min, which could theoretically heat and cool 20,000 homes. Using the water stored in the mines would conservatively extend this option to an order of magnitude more sites. Based on current energy prices, geothermal heat pump systems using mine water could reduce annual costs for heating by 67\% and cooling by 50\% over conventional methods (natural gas or heating oil and standard air conditioning).},

	abstract = {The flooding of the Lorraine coal mines (France), representing a huge reservoir of about 154×106m3, began in June 2006. After attaining thermal equilibrium with the surrounding rocks, the water temperature in the deepest parts is expected to reach 55°C, giving the opportunity for the extraction of low-enthalpy geothermal waters that may be suitable for district heating purposes. We present some numerical modelling results of the thermally driven convective flow in an open vertical shaft and in the entire mine reservoir. A dual permeability/porosity approach was used in the reservoir model, which includes open galleries and vertical shafts, coal panels backfilled with sand, and intact rock masses. Two scenarios of heat extraction with different flow regimes were investigated. A sensitivity analysis shows that the temperature decline in the production zone is highly dependent on the permeability of the surrounding porous rocks. Larger permeabilities result in higher water temperatures at the production shaft due to greater inflows of warm water from those rock masses.},

	abstract = {In the last decades numerous coal mines have been closed. One way to overtake the costs associated to the mine closure is the geothermal use of the water stored in the closed and flooded mine workings. The temperature of the water flooding from the mine voids, in some cases reaching depths of several hundreds of meters, is suitable for space heating and cooling by means of the use of ground source (geothermal) heat pumps (low-enthalpy geothermal systems). Flooded mine voids constitute new-created pseudokarstic aquifers or reservoirs, which can store significant volumes of groundwater. However, the recharge and the heat capacity of these systems are finite, and this is the main concern when using mine water as a heat source or sink. These reservoirs can be regulated by means of flow extraction and injection depending on the use demands; notwithstanding, these flows have to be limited to a sustainable value, in order to avoid the exhaustion of the capacity of the aquifer to provide or store heat. Several numerical and analytical models have been created with this aim, with the shortage of hydrogeological and thermal data as main drawback. A literature review of the existent flow and heat transfer models applied to geothermal use of mine water has been undertaken, both analytical and numerical models are considered. The main parameters that have influence in the flow and heat exchange processes, have been analysed. The present paper can be used as basic guidelines to aid when selecting a modelling method for a specific scenario.},

A strong case can be made for retaining these large-scale, often continuous and very detailed geological sections that might otherwise have been lost to us, along with their relevant digital geological and geotechnical datasets and other social and industrial records. In particular, Spireslack and Mainshill Wood opencast workings might be seen by some as industrial scars on the Scottish landscape, but they can instead both be turned into national assets for multidisciplinary Geoscience research and learning in general, supporting high-quality international research into Carboniferous geology. Such opencast sites can also provide a rich visitor and/or learning experience for the wider public in coal geology, illuminating aspects of a former way of life of previous generations.},

The latter half of the 20th century saw major advances in the reclamation technologies. However, mine water pollution problems have not been addressed. In many cases, polluted mine water long outlives the life of the mining operation. As the true cost of long-term water treatment responsibilities has become apparent, interest has grown in the technologies that would decrease the production of contaminated water and make its treatment less costly. This is the first book to address the mine water issue head-on. The authors explain the complexities of mine water pollution by reviewing the hydrogeological context of its formation, and provide an up-to-date presentation of prevention and treatment technologies. The book will be a valuable reference for all professionals who encounter polluted mine water on a regular or occasional basis.},

	isbn = {17-45.0305-8719/02/\$15.00},
	abstract = {The hydrogeological effects of longwall mines are vertically zoned. The heavily fractured strata immediately above the mine dewater, but they are typically overlain by a zone of low permeability that prevents shallower aquifers from draining to the mine. However, shallow bedrock aquifers experience head changes caused by fracturing during subsidence. New fracture void space takes up water, causing large head drops especially in confined aquifers. Increased fracture permeability affects heads because upper aquifers in high relief areas lose water through fractured aquitards to lower aquifers, and because the higher permeabilities lower hydraulic gradients and up-gradient heads, and increase down- gradient discharge. In addition, a secondary drawdown spreads out laterally through transmissive aquifers from the potentiometric low in the subsiding zone. After undermining, water levels may recover due to closure of fractures and to recharge flowing back into the affected area. Studies at two active longwall mines in Pennsylvanian coal measures in Illinois support the conceptual model, with variations. Unconsolidated, unconfined aquifers were not significantly affected by mining. At one site, heads in a moderately transmissive sandstone declined due to mining but recovered fully afterwards. Increased permeability led to enhanced well yields, but water quality deteriorated, probably because of oxidation and mobilization of in situ sulphides during the unconfined and recovery phases. At the other site, heads in a poorly transmissive sandstone fell rapidly during subsidence and did not recover; hydrogeological responses varied at the site scale due to variations in bedrock-drift continuity. Predictions and monitoring schemes can be guided by the general conceptual model, but must consider local hydrogeological variations. Effects in shallow aquifers not in direct contact with the mine can be simulated using readily available flow models.},

	volume = {36},
	abstract = {The research into a geothermal energy option for Northern
Alberta basin is currently underway. Correct estimates of heat
flow and geothermal gradient for the sedimentary strata (direct
heat energy option) and deeper crystalline basement are needed.
A series of detailed geophysical logs and boreholes studies have
recently been collected in the Hunt well {AOC} {GRANITE} 7-32-
89-10. The well was drilled 2.36 km into basement granitic rocks
just west of Fort {McMurray}. A temperature log acquired as part
of the University of Alberta Helmholtz-Alberta Initiative ({HAI})
geothermal energy project in 2010-2011shows that there is a
significant increase in thermal gradient in the granites. Inversion of the measured T-z profile between 550 m – 2320 m indicates a
temperature increase of 9.6+/- 0.3 {oC}, at 13.0 +/- 0.6 ka and that the glacial base surface temperature was - 4.4+/- 0.3 {oC}. This
inversion computation accounted for granite heat production of
3 W/m3. We find from the Hunt well study that heat flow in the
basin has been underestimated for wells shallower than 2 km
due to the paleoclimatic effect. A significant increase in surface temperatures since the end of the last ice age in northern North
America causes a perturbation of shallow {\textless}2 km heat flows. For
this reason, estimates of gradient based on single or numerous
data from different depths are not necessarly characteristic of the whole sedimentary column and can lead to spurious predictions
of temperature at depth needed for geothermal energy or hydrocarbon models.},

The model results are very sensitive to the value of this poorly constrained parameter.

Despite this apparent success, it is concluded that such modeling approaches generally lack predictive power for mines in permeable, porous host rocks.

However, the use of numerical models in mining hydrogeology has certain limitations resulting from existing uncertainties as to the assumed hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions. They include shortcomings in the identification of hydrogeological conditions, cyclic changes of precipitation and evaporation, changes resulting from land management due to mining activity, changes in mining work schedules, and post-mining void flooding. Even though groundwater flow models used in mining hydrogeology have numerous limitations, they still provide the most comprehensive information concerning the mine dewatering and flooding processes and their influence on the environment. However, they will always require periodical verification based on new information on the actual response of the aquifer system to the mine drainage and the actual climate conditions, as well as up-to-date schedules of deposit extraction and mine closure.},

	abstract = {Underground longwall mining of coal causes large scale disturbance of the surrounding rock mass. The disturbance can increase the rock mass permeability through a reduction on the stress as well as formation of new fractures in the rock. Methane gas contained in the disturbed rock mass can migrate towards the low pressure mine workings and present an explosion hazard. This paper describes the application of a finite difference program to develop a geomechanical model that predicts permeability changes within the rock mass. The calculated permeabilities are used as input to a reservoir simulator that models methane desorption from the coal matrix, methane release from the rock layers and flow towards the mine excavations. The model also considers the basic characteristics of the mine ventilation network.},

	abstract = {Methane can be a significant hazard in coal mine longwalling operations and extensive methane mitigation techniques are employed by coal mine operators. Reservoir modeling techniques are used to better understand the liberation and migration of methane from the surrounding rocks towards the mine ventilation system. The caved rock behind the advancing longwall face, known as the gob, can contain high void ratios, providing high permeability flow paths to the methane. The gob is progressively compacted by the weight of the overburden, resulting in a reduction in the void ratio and associated permeability. Estimating the permeability distribution within the gob poses challenges due to its complexity. The authors have developed a new methodology to determine both horizontal and vertical variations in the permeability of the gob. Variations of the permeability in the vertical direction are based on a model of caving and block rotation, which considers the effect of block dimensions and fall height on the void ratio. Gob compaction by the overburden and associated permeability changes are determined from a three-dimensional geo- mechanical model which simulates the gob as a strain hardening granular material. The resulting three-dimensional permeability distribution in the gob is then transferred to a reservoir model. The paper demonstrates the application of the method and shows that reasonable results are obtained when compared to empirical experience and measurements.},

The heat in the water is derived from the normal heat of the rocks, and the contribution from chemical heating is negligible. Water is used as the input to heat pumps for heating and cooling industrial buildings. Annual heat exchange with the mine by the largest user puts more heat into the mine in summer than is taken out in winter. Other buildings may be a small net drain of heat, so that many systems could operate indefinitely, without significant depletion of the heat source. Initial costs of heat-pump installation are higher than the costs of conventional oil furnaces, but in Springhill operating costs of geothermal heating are substantially lower than heating by fuel oil. There is a net saving in the emission of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The terrestrial heat flux density, an essential information to evaluate the deep geothermal resource potential, is rarely defined over urban areas where energy needs are important. In an effort to fill this gap, the subsurface thermal conductivity estimated during two thermal response tests was coupled with undisturbed temperature profile measurements conducted in the same boreholes to infer terrestrial heat flow near the surface. The undisturbed temperature profiles were reproduced with an inverse numerical model of conductive heat transfer, where the optimization of the model bottom boundary condition allows determining the near-surface heat flow. The inverse numerical simulation approach was previously validated by optimizing a steady-state and synthetic temperature profile calculated with Fourier's Law. Data from two thermal response tests in ground heat exchangers of one hundred meters depth were analyzed with inverse numerical simulations provided as examples for the town of Québec City, Canada, and Orléans, France. The temperature profiles measured at the sites and corrected according to the paleoclimate effects of the quaternary glaciations were reproduced with the model. The approach presented offers an alternative to assess heat flow in the preliminary exploration of deep geothermal resources of urban areas, where thermal response tests may be common while deep wells are sparsely distributed over the area to assess heat flow.},

	abstract = {Abstract. New temperature measurements from eight boreholes in the West African Craton ({WAC}) reveal superficial perturbations down to 100 m below the alteration zone. These perturbations are both related to a recent increase in the surface air temperature ({SAT}) and to the site effects caused by fluid circulations and/or the lower conduction in the alterites. The ground surface temperature ({GST}), inverted from the boreholes temperatures, increased slowly in the past ({\textasciitilde}0.4 °C from 1700 to 1940) and then, more importantly, in recent years ({\textasciitilde}1.5 °C from 1940 to 2010). This recent trend is consistent with the increase of the {SAT} recorded at two nearby meteorological stations (Tambacounda and Kedougou), and more generally in the Sahel with a coeval rainfall decrease. Site effects are superimposed to the climatic effect and interpreted by advective (circulation of fluids) or conductive (lower conductivity of laterite and of high-porosity sand) perturbations. We used a 1-D finite differences thermal model and a Monte-Carlo procedure to find the best estimates of these site perturbations: all the eight borehole temperature logs can be interpreted with the same basal heat-flow and the same surface temperature history, but with some realistic changes of thermal conductivity and/or fluid velocity. The {GST} trend observed in Senegal can be confirmed by two previous borehole measurements made in 1983 in other locations of West Africa, the first one in an arid zone of northern Mali and the second one in a sub-humid zone in southern Mali. Finally, the background heat-flow is low (31±2 {mW} m−2), which makes this part of the {WAC} more similar with the observations in the southern part (33±8 {mW} m−2) rather than with those in the northern part and in the Pan-African domains where the surface heat-flow is 15–20 {mW} m−2 higher.},

            The paper presents results of the research on the impact of solar radiation on the formation of the thermal conditions of the exposed rock surfaces of the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland. The research comprised the structure of the radiation balance of the active surface of the bottom of the canyon, the temperature of the surface and the layer at the depth of −5 cm in limestone rock on the southern wall of the canyon. The tests were performed in various types of weather. The strongest mesoclimate contrasts were observed in the radiation type of weather: differences in insolation and in the balance of radiation, thermal differences and variations within the heat flux in the rock. The longwave stream of radiation which was emitted by the heated rocks exerted an impact on the microclimate conditions and on the radiation balance at the bottom of the canyon during the night. A diverse relief of the terrain constituted a local factor differentiating the radiation balance and the distribution of the rock temperature. The quantitatively determined structure of the radiation balance and the thermal contrasts of the canyon, particularly of the rock surfaces, point to the importance of the relief in shaping the mesoclimate of even small karst areas. These characteristics determine the heat flux in the rock, weathering processes and others. The mesoclimate and microclimate of the rocks affect the biodiversity of the rock surfaces of the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland. In addition, they shape the ecotopy of the karst canyon, among others – the vegetation on the limestone rocks.},

A lack of observations of subsurface temperature collected over decades limits interpretation of the combined influences of surface warming and groundwater flow on subsurface thermal regimes. Subsurface temperature-depth profile data acquired for Kumamoto Plain, Japan, between 1987 and 2012 were collected and analyzed to elucidate regional groundwater and heat flows. The observed and simulated temperature-depth profiles showed the following: subsurface water flows from northeast to southwest in the study area; the combined influence of surface warming and water flow perturbation produces different temporal changes in thermal profiles in recharge, intermediate, and discharge areas; and aquifer thermal properties contribute more than hydraulic parameters to the perturbation of temperature-depth profiles. Spatial and temporal evolution features of subsurface thermal regimes may be utilized to investigate the influence of surface warming events on subsurface water and heat flows at the basin scale.},

The most commonly used method for active field assessment is the thermal response test ({TRT}), which consists of circulating heated water in a pilot ground heat exchanger ({GHE}) where temperature and flow rate are monitored. The transient thermal perturbation is analyzed to evaluate the subsurface thermal conductivity. Heat injection can also be performed with a heating cable in the {GHE} to conduct a {TRT} without water circulation, which can be affected by surface temperature variations. Passive methods, such as the interpretation of geophysical well logs and the analysis of temperature profiles measured in exploration wells, are emerging as alternatives to {TRTs}. Steady-state and transient laboratory measurements performed on samples collected in surface outcrops or drill cores can also be achieved. Methods to characterize the subsurface in the context of geothermal system design have evolved significantly since the original {TRT} concept proposed during the 1980s with different techniques inspired from the Earth science sector.},

	abstract = {A ground source heat pump ({GSHP}) system has higher performance than air source heat pump system due to the use of more efficient ground heat source. However, the {GSHP} system performance depends on ground thermal properties and groundwater conditions. There are many studies on the improvement of {GSHP} system by developing ground heat exchanger ({GHX}) and heat exchange method. Several studies have suggested methods to improve heat exchange rate for the development of {GHX}. However, few real-scale experimental studies have quantitatively analyzed their performance using the same ground conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the thermal performance of various pipe types of {GHX} by the thermal response test ({TRT}) under the same field and test conditions. Four kinds of {GHX} ({HDPE} type, {HDPE}-nano type, spiral fin type, and coaxial type) were constructed in the same site. Inlet and outlet temperatures of {GHXs} and effective thermal conductivity were measured through the {TRT}. In addition, the borehole thermal resistance was calculated to comparatively analyze the correlation of the heat exchange performance with each {GHX}. Result of the {TRT} revealed that averages effective thermal conductivities of {HDPE} type, {HDPE}-nano, spiral fin type, and coaxial type {GHX} were 2.25 W/m·K, 2.34 W/m·K, 2.55 W/m·K, and 2.16 W/m·K, respectively. In the result, it was found that the average borehole thermal resistance can be an important factor in {TRT}, but the effect of increased thermal conductivity of pipe material itself was not significant.},

It can be also used for evaluation of the heating possibilities of heat pumps; to proper design the size of the ground exchangers and the depth, at which they should be installed. For this purpose, a mathematical model based on the heat balance equation on the ground surface was developed. The basis of the model is the Carslaw-Jaeger equation regarding the temperature profile in the ground. The model was verified using experimental results for two different locations (different climatic conditions, moderate and arid climate)—the standard deviation is equal 0.62 K and 0.92 K, respectively. In this work, the impact of several parameters on the ground temperature profiles and thermal fluxes was determined. It was found that among the examined parameters the amplitude of the daily average solar radiation flux strongly effects on the total amount of heat transferred between the ground and the environment during the year, wherein the other parameters have a negligible effect.},

	abstract = {Borehole thermal energy storage ({BTES}) exploits the high volumetric heat capacity of rock-forming minerals and pore water to store large quantities of heat (or cold) on a seasonal basis in the geological environment. The {BTES} is a volume of rock or sediment accessed via an array of borehole heat exchangers ({BHE}). Even well-designed {BTES} arrays will lose a significant quantity of heat to the adjacent and subjacent rocks/sediments and to the surface; both theoretical calculations and empirical observations suggest that seasonal thermal recovery factors in excess of 50\% are difficult to obtain. Storage efficiency may be dramatically reduced in cases where (i) natural groundwater advection through the {BTES} removes stored heat, (ii) extensive free convection cells (thermosiphons) are allowed to form, and (iii) poor {BTES} design results in a high surface area/volume ratio of the array shape, allowing high conductive heat losses. The most efficient array shape will typically be a cylinder with similar dimensions of diameter and depth, preferably with an insulated top surface. Despite the potential for moderate thermal recovery, the sheer volume of thermal storage that the natural geological environment offers can still make {BTES} a very attractive strategy for seasonal thermal energy storage within a “smart” district heat network, especially when coupled with more efficient surficial engineered dynamic thermal energy stores ({DTES}).},

	abstract = {Borehole thermal energy storage ({BTES}) exploits the high volumetric heat capacity of rock-forming minerals and pore water to store large quantities of heat (or cold) on a seasonal basis in the geological environment. The {BTES} is a volume of rock or sediment accessed via an array of borehole heat exchangers ({BHE}). Even well-designed {BTES} arrays will lose a significant quantity of heat to the adjacent and subjacent rocks/sediments and to the surface; both theoretical calculations and empirical observations suggest that seasonal thermal recovery factors in excess of 50\% are difficult to obtain. Storage efficiency may be dramatically reduced in cases where (i) natural groundwater advection through the {BTES} removes stored heat, (ii) extensive free convection cells (thermosiphons) are allowed to form, and (iii) poor {BTES} design results in a high surface area/volume ratio of the array shape, allowing high conductive heat losses. The most efficient array shape will typically be a cylinder with similar dimensions of diameter and depth, preferably with an insulated top surface. Despite the potential for moderate thermal recovery, the sheer volume of thermal storage that the natural geological environment offers can still make {BTES} a very attractive strategy for seasonal thermal energy storage within a “smart” district heat network, especially when coupled with more efficient surficial engineered dynamic thermal energy stores ({DTES}).},

	abstract = {A ground source heat pump ({GSHP}) system has higher performance than air source heat pump system due to the use of more efficient ground heat source. However, the {GSHP} system performance depends on ground thermal properties and groundwater conditions. There are many studies on the improvement of {GSHP} system by developing ground heat exchanger ({GHX}) and heat exchange method. Several studies have suggested methods to improve heat exchange rate for the development of {GHX}. However, few real-scale experimental studies have quantitatively analyzed their performance using the same ground conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the thermal performance of various pipe types of {GHX} by the thermal response test ({TRT}) under the same field and test conditions. Four kinds of {GHX} ({HDPE} type, {HDPE}-nano type, spiral fin type, and coaxial type) were constructed in the same site. Inlet and outlet temperatures of {GHXs} and effective thermal conductivity were measured through the {TRT}. In addition, the borehole thermal resistance was calculated to comparatively analyze the correlation of the heat exchange performance with each {GHX}. Result of the {TRT} revealed that averages effective thermal conductivities of {HDPE} type, {HDPE}-nano, spiral fin type, and coaxial type {GHX} were 2.25 W/m·K, 2.34 W/m·K, 2.55 W/m·K, and 2.16 W/m·K, respectively. In the result, it was found that the average borehole thermal resistance can be an important factor in {TRT}, but the effect of increased thermal conductivity of pipe material itself was not significant.},

	abstract = {This study aims at evaluating the feasibility of an installation for space heating and cooling the building of the university in the center of the city Aachen, Germany, with a 2500 m deep coaxial borehole heat exchanger ({BHE}). Direct heating the building in winter requires temperatures of 40°C. In summer, cooling the university building uses a climatic control adsorption unit, which requires a temperature of minimum 55°C. The drilled rocks of the 2500 m deep borehole have extremely low permeabilities and porosities less than 1\%. Their thermal conductivity varies between 2.2 W/(m·K) and 8.9 W/(m·K). The high values are related to the quartzite sandstones. The maximum temperature in the borehole is 85°C at 2500 m depth, which corresponds to a mean specific heat flow of 85 {mW}/m
              2
              –90 {mW}/m
              2
              . Results indicate that for a short period, the borehole may deliver the required temperature. But after a 20-year period of operation, temperatures are too low to drive the adsorption unit for cooling. In winter, however, the borehole heat exchanger may still supply the building with sufficient heat, with temperatures varying between 25 and 55°C and a circulation flow rate of 10 m
