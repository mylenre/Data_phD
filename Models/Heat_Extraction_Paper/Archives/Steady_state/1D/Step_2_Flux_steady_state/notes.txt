Steady state with Flux
CST_FLUX: From seatdy state gradient
model temperature profile for 1000 years using flux +/-0.066495 W/m2
--> Test1:slight change in surface temperature
--> test2: correct flux using Python srcipt: only slight increase in temperature over 1000 years

For areal studies (74 and 2200 m2), used steady state profile as IC

SOLAR: use surface top boundary as solar flux variations 6 +/-0.064736W/m2 + RELOAD
--> annual variations have effects down to 20 m depth
BUT over 50 years (18300 days), see shift in gradient down to 60 m depth (near surface conductivity = 1.2)
Why that shift that we don't see in constant surface flux?
--> temperature seems to reach quasi cyclical steady state, use it as input for PROD

PROD: add prod -1000 W/m distributed along polyline 50-90m for an area of 2200 m2
- using constant extraction
- using cyclical extraction

need to compare them: at time step 181 (30 years): at a yearly average, extraction doesn't matter even if cyclical production

+ increase borehole length in zone impacted by solar recharge (see Excel file)
