Integrated temperature difference along profile after 30 years of production, for: 
 a 1D rock column (2200 m2) with infinite vertical recharge (no lateral recharge): 1815.825, 
 a 1D rock column (2200 m2) of BHE height (20 m): 1824.72, 
 at 26.5m from the BHE for an infinite 3D rock volume (lateral and vertical recharge): 449.558
 and at 26.5m from the BHE for a volume with lateral recharge only: 438.053
In those models, only the geothermal flux contribute to recharge, as steady state gradient and heat comes from below (explain the cooling at the surface).
Percentage axial recharge (1D) : 69.1%
Percentage lateral recharge : 76.0%
Percentage axial recharge (3D) : 68.9%
