Meeting Chris:

- 1D model using purely temperature diffusion (no GW flow)
- 3D model: issue with stability criteria
- feedback on draft?

- worked on heat sources: hard to find detailed mineralogical analysis of rocks
- looked at structure of bilston glen area to create geological / conceptual model
- simulation of temperature change in 2D mines under different boundary conditions 
- still waiting for data from the CA but got profiles from Bates

- confirmation report: Data management plan Ethics Determination Form
  where to store data ?
  need to think about specific for the Research Ethics and Integrity Assessment Form ?
