what is the purpose for starting my phD ? 
What will success look like for my PhD; personally / professionally.

trello
productivity tracking app

to do list for the dau but in a bigger frame goal
everything doesn't need to be perfect
get feedbacks on things done in a defined time frame
pomodoro box
2 minute rule: get things done

what is realistic for both of us
- frequency (short but frequent meetings ?)
- how interact (zoom, teams )
- scheldule meetings long in advance + feedbacks
 first on structure -, then on writing
- better to get feedback on rough draft than spending time polishing
- be specific on feedback I need
- define clear role for second supervisor
- need to ask for deadline
- add meeting in diary 
- agenda with key points
