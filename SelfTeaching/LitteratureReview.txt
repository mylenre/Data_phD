not a simple summary 
survey of litterature, highlight important things (narrative review != systematic review)
but synthesis = (reorganisation of the information) of where we are in a particular topic
critical evaluation, current state of knowledge and analysis of gap 
analysis of similarities, differences + controversies and try to explain them
broad and deep, clear and concise 
not simply confined to description of what has been said 
to show familiar with subject a work is credible 

use endnote to manage citations and references
take notes during reading
link the dotes (the different papers)
during writing
highlight similarities and differences + include my own analysis (note what is not done and controversies)
using link words show critical / integrated analtsis of papers (connection, dissimilarities, gab)
take a step back and look at bigger picture to integrate analysis and interpretation
"brings together"
"argues"
"similarly"
"however", "nevertheless"
"more recently"
"current thinking"
"further analysis"
concluding sentense at each paragraph
