    "The purpose of this program is to calculate the energy available as heat or for chemical reactions and the specific heat production of six nuclides ($^{26}$Al, $^{40}$K, $^{60}$Fe, $^{232}$Th, $^{235}$U, and $^{238}$U), which are geologically important as heat sources, especially in the context of the formation, evolution, and geodynamics of terrestrial planetary bodies.\n",

    "All half-lives are converted into years, with the relation between seconds and years defined as in NUBASE2016 (Audi *et al.*, 2017). Energy calculations use energies in keV. Atomic masses of isotopes are taken from AME2016 (Wang *et al.*, 2017), the elemental averages and isotopic abundances from IUPAC 2013 (Meija *et al.*, 2016a,b), and the half-lives are from NUBASE2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nuclide-specific decay data (energies and intensities) were obtained from the [NuDat v.2.7$\\beta$ website of the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC) of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, USA](http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/index.jsp), and the [Recommended Data site of the Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel, Saclay, France](http://www.nucleide.org/DDEP_WG/DDEPdata.htm). In general, the newest available data were used.\n",

    "## <a id='genproc'></a>General procedure\n",
    "The decay chain of the nuclide is followed through most of its branches, leaving out only very minor (improbable) ones in some instances. Total decay energies $Q$ are calculated from the mass difference of parent and decay products of the step in the chain. For $\\alpha$ decay, this is equivalent to the energy available for heating. For $\\beta^-$ and $\\beta^+$ decay, the energy carried by (anti)neutrinos is subtracted; for the latter, the annihilation of the positron and an electron are taken into account as an additional heat-effective energy term. For electron capture (ec), only the radiative part is converted into heat. As all decay series happen to start with nuclides whose half-lives $T_{1/2}$ are orders of magnitude longer than that of any of the daughters, it is the parent half-life that is used for power calculations; the `lambda_s` decay constants written out for each step are for informational purposes only."

    "$^{40}$K is the most abundant of the four still extant nuclides considered here and is of special interest because it is assumed to contribute most of the radiogenic heat of the core; its present-day fraction in K is $1.1668\\times 10^{-4}$ (Naumenko *et al.*, 2013). It has two important decay branches, both of which produce stable daughters: the most likely ($I=0.8928$) decay is a $\\beta^-$ decay directly to the ground state of $^{40}$Ca, the other ($I=0.1072$) produces $^{40}$Ar by electron capture, as does the third, very low-probability $\\beta^+$ branch (NuDat v.2.7$\\beta$, Chen, 2017). As the branch leading to $^{40}$Ca decays directly into the ground state, there is no $\\gamma$ contribution. Note that up to now, the mean $\\beta$ energy in the $\\beta^-$ decay to $^{40}$Ca was underestimated in nuclear data evaluations. The value of 583.55 keV adopted here is a recent recalculation that overcomes limitations in older evaluations related to the correct treatment of 3rd forbidden unique transitions such as this one (Mougeot, 2015 and pers.comm. 2017); it is the mean of a calculation with the full calculated $\\beta$ spectrum and a calculation based on an experimental shape factor, using $Q$ as derived from AME2016.\n",

    "The present-day isotopic fraction of ${}^{40}$K and the ratio $r_{40}=X_{40}/X_{39}$ were recently redetermined by Naumenko *et al.* (2013). The fraction was found to be the same as the four decades old one given in Meija *et al.* (2016b) within error, but for consistency we recalculate the mean atomic mass using the best estimates from Naumenko *et al.* (2013), $X_{40}=1.1668\\times 10^{-4}$ and $r_{40}=1.25116\\times 10^{-4}$, and the tabulated masses of the three relevant isotopes, of which two are stable:\n",

As the half-life of the intermediate step is more than six orders of magnitude shorter than that of $^{60}$Fe, the $T_{1/2}$ of the latter is assumed to apply to the entire chain. However, it is the second decay step that contributes more than 95% of the total heat. - As the isotope is extinct, the power calculation for bulk Fe returns zero by default; this can be changed by assigning a non-zero value to `Xiso`."

    "Of the six radionuclides considered, $^{232}$Th is the one with the longest half-life ($T_{1/2}\\approx 14$ Gy), and it is the only isotope of Th that exists today in appreciable amounts. It has a long decay chain consisting of several $\\alpha$ and $\\beta^-$ decays, but as the half-lives of all unstable daughters are between 9 and 18 orders of magnitude shorter, $T_{1/2}=14$ Gy is used for all rate calculations. While heat production calculation from the $\\alpha$ decays is straightforward and requires only the masses of the parent and daughter, care must be taken with the $\\beta^-$ decays of $^{228}$Ra (Luca, 2009 2012), $^{228}$Ac (NuDat v.2.7$\\beta$, Abusaleem, 2014), $^{212}$Pb (Nichols, 2011b,c), $^{212}$Bi (Nichols, 2011a,d), and $^{208}$Tl (Nichols, 2010, 2016), all of which feed several different excited energy levels of their respective daughters. Moreover, $^{212}$Bi has two decay branches: it can decay via the $\\alpha$ branch ($I=0.3593$) to $^{208}$Tl or via the $\\beta^-$ branch ($I=0.6407$) to $^{212}$Po (Nichols, 2011d), and the decay energies of the daughters have to be weighted accordingly. Note that in some cases the $\\beta^-$ branch of $^{212}$Bi leads to a $^{212}$Po$^\\mathrm{m}$ state that proceeds directly via $\\alpha$ decay to $^{208}$Pb, i.e., without passing through the $^{212}$Po ground state by $\\gamma$ emission; this branch is not accounted for explicitly in the energy calculation, but it is in fact included in the final sum, because it is energetically equivalent to the path through the ground state.\n",

    "$^{235}$U is the less abundant and shorter-lived ($T_{1/2}=704$ My; Huang & Wang, 2014) of the two major uranium isotopes. Its decay chain is even longer and more complicated than that of $^{232}$Th and yields $^{207}$Pb as well as 7 atoms of $^{4}$He as final products. The decay branch from $^{223}$Fr to $^{219}$At has a very low probability, and therefore the subsequent steps of that branch are omitted from the calculation; they merge with the main decay path at different points. With regard to the energy balance, the $\\beta^-$ decays of $^{231}$Th (NuDat v.2.7$\\beta$, Browne & Tuli, 2013a), $^{227}$Ac (NuDat v.2.7$\\beta$, Kondev *et al.*, 2016), $^{223}$Fr (Huang & Wang, 2009, 2012), $^{211}$Pb (NuDat v.2.7$\\beta$, Singh *et al.*, 2013), and $^{207}$Tl (NuDat v.2.7$\\beta$, Kondev & Lalkovski, 2011) require attention because of the neutrino component. A possible, very low-probability $\\beta^-$ decay path from $^{207}$Tl$^\\mathrm{m}$ to $^{207}$Pb is not treated individually but as if it were identical to the path via the $^{207}$Tl ground state."

    "The other, much more abundant isotope $^{238}$U has a half-life close to the age of the Solar System, $T_{1/2}=4468$ My, and a similarly long and complex decay chain. It yields $^{206}$Pb as well as 8 atoms of $^{4}$He as final products. The isomeric transition (IT) of $^{234}$Pa was treated separately because of the slightly different $\\beta^-$ energies, but the very low-probability $\\beta^-$ branch of $^{218}$At and two similar branches of $^{210}$Pb to $^{206}$Hg and of $^{210}$Bi to $^{206}$Tl are not included. Energy is lost by neutrinos in the $\\beta^-$ decays of $^{234}$Th (Luca, 2009b, 2010), $^{234}$Pa$^\\mathrm{m}$ and $^{234}$Pa (Huang & Wang, 2011a-d), $^{218}$Po (Chisté & Bé, 2007a, 2010c), $^{214}$Pb (Chisté & Bé, 2010a,b), $^{214}$Bi (NuDat v.2.7$\\beta$, Wu, 2009), $^{210}$Tl, $^{210}$Pb (NuDat v.2.7$\\beta$, Basunia, 2014), and $^{210}$Bi (Chisté *et al.*, 2014). The mass of the excited isomer $^{234}$Pa$^\\mathrm{m}$ is determined from the mass of the ground state of $^{234}$Pa and the energy of the $\\gamma$ photon emitted upon decay to the ground level, which is determined to be 73.92 keV (Luca, 2010); this calculation is done on the fly with the function `keV2u`."
