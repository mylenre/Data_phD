perturbations down to 100m depth : 10 000 yr climatic effects
- i.e. warming of 0.44°C/decade, surface temperature BC (Batir et al., 2017)
-  assumed homogeneous thermal diffusivity in these experiments was 10−6m2/s (Lesperance et al, 2010)

perturbations down to 20 m depth : yealy/seasonal fluctuations: good paper to look at
- Ground temperature in the subsurface layer depends on location and time [1]. The thickness of this layer depends on the thermal diffusivity of the ground. For low values of thermal diffusivity the subsurface layer has a small thickness, but when the thermal diffusivity of the ground is high, the stabilisation of the ground temperature occurs at larger depths. Most often, the depths of subsurface layers, depending on the thermal properties of the ground, are in the range of 8 to 18 m. (Gwadera et al, 2017)
- well temperature inversion and temperature profile simulation using LST and convection/conductivity perturbations (LucazeauAndRolandone_2012)

Caputa, 2016: perturbations down to 5 cm: 
- The net Q* reached positive values during the
day, whereas almost 3 hours before sunset and during the night it decreased to negative values, reaching its minimum of –36 W/m2 by astronomical sunset, and then increasing slowly to about –10 W/m2 by sunrise. 
- the amount of radiation that reaches the gound heat the rock surface with a delay time after sunrise, which then rise the air temperature
- cooling during the night (slower cooling of the rock compared to the air du to the lower heat capacity of the air) -->  large negative heat flux within the rock 
- max heat flux of 700 W/m2 during the day and 0 during the night --> variation of temperature between 12 and 30°C at the rock surface and 12 and 25°C at 5 cm depth 


I0 (irradiance) = 1420 - 1320 W/m2

Outgoing heat (heat radiated from Earth) ~84-350 W/m2

The atmosphere +surface of the Earth absorb 71% of incoming solar radiation, 
- atmosphere absorbs 23% and radiates heat equivalent to 59% of incoming sunlight  
- surface absorbs 48% and radiates only 12%
In other words, most solar heating happens at the surface, while most radiative cooling happens in the atmosphere.

1) plot seasonal variations with negative flux (< 20 m depth)
2) plot seasonal variations with varying temperature (< 20 m)
3) plot linear temperature increase for 10 000 years (< 500 m)
4) plot both climatic + yearly T change
