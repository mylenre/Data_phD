abstract = "In this study the potential for data center waste heat utilization was analyzed in the Nordic countries. An overview of upcoming data center projects where waste heat is utilized is presented. Especially in Finland data center operators are planning to reuse waste heat in district heating. However, business models between the district heating network operator and data center operator are often not transparent. The implications of economics and emissions on waste heat utilization in district heating were analyzed through life cycle assessment. Currently the biggest barriers for utilizing waste heat are the low quality of waste heat (e.g. low temperature or unstable source of heat) and high investment costs. A systematic 8-step change process was suggested to ensure success in changing the priority of waste heat utilization in the data center and district heating market. Relevant energy efficiency metrics were introduced to support rational decision-making in the reuse of waste heat. Economic calculations showed that the investment payback time is under the estimated lifetime of the heat pump equipment, when waste heat was utilized in district heating. However, the environmental impact of waste heat utilization depends on the fuel, which waste heat replaces."

Achieving this integration requires the investigation of different technical and infrastructural options, as well as economic analyses for improved implementation. In the city of Linz (Austria), the existing industry exhibits significant unused waste heat potentials which could be integrated into the existing urban DH system, however, a seasonal storage is required due to the competition with an existing waste incineration plant. This paper shows, that a strategic operation of the seasonal storage could increase the number of charging cycles and thereby increase significantly the revenues of the system. This is mainly due to the combined utilization of the storage in a seasonal approach to shift the waste heat from summer to the winter period and as a short term buffer. Thus, the profits from actively participating on the electricity market with the existing combined heat and power (CHP) plants are increased."

This paper focuses on the case study of the industrial city of Linz (Austria), and demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of seasonal heat storage. The interaction between the storage system with optimal cogeneration plant dispatch and industrial waste heat integration is explained. Furthermore, the most important parameters of the heat storage in order to achieve economic feasibility are highlighted. One main finding is that the number of annual cycles is crucial for a seasonal heat storage. The amortization period is computed to be about 20 years, and is shown to be extremely sensitive to changes in electricity, gas and CO2 prices."

This may be due, on one hand, to the technical and economic difficulties in applying conventional heat recovery methods and, on the other, the temporary or geographical mismatch between the energy released and its heat demand. Thermal energy storage (TES) is a technology which can solve the existing mismatch by recovering the IWH and storing it for a later use. Moreover, the use of recovered IWH leads to a decrease of CO2 emissions and to economic and energy savings. Depending on the distance between the IWH source and the heat demand, TES systems can be placed on-site or the IWH can be transported by means of mobile TES systems, to an off-site heat demand. Around 50 industry case studies, in which both on-site and off-site recovery systems are considered are here reviewed and discussed taking into account the characteristics of the heat source, the heat, the TES system, and the economic, environmental and energy savings. Besides, the trends and the maturity of the cases reviewed have been considered. On-site TES systems in the basic metals manufacturing are the technology and industrial sector which has focused the most attention among the researchers, respectively. Moreover, water (or steam), erythritol and zeolite are the TES materials used in most industries and space comfort and electricity generation are the most recurrent applications."

abstract = "Solar energy storage has been an active research area among the various solar energy applications over the past few decades. As an important technology for solving the time-discrepancy problem of solar energy utilisation, seasonal/long-term storage is a challenging key technology for space heating and can significantly increase the solar fraction. It widens the use of solar collectors and results in better solar coverage of the space heating demand. This paper reviews all three available technologies for seasonal heat storage: sensible heat storage, latent heat storage and chemical storage. Sensible heat storage is a comparatively mature technology that has been implemented and evaluated in many large-scale demonstration plants. Water, rock-sort material and ground/soil are frequently used as storage materials. Latent heat and chemical storage have much higher energy storage densities than sensible storage, which means that they can remarkably reduce the storage volume, and they seldom suffer from heat loss problems. However, the latter two technologies are currently still in the stages of material investigations and lab-scale experiments. The characteristics of each concept have been presented in detail in this review. The latest studies and related projects are reviewed. The paper is structured as follows: fundamental investigation on storage materials, existing plants or projects and future outlook."

@misc{8923296,
abstract     = {The incineration furnace at National Veterinary Institute (SVA) in Uppsala, Sweden, runs approximately 2,150 hours a year and generates a large amount of waste heat. Some of this heat is partially recovered, and is used for heating one of the main buildings during the furnace operation. However, around 2,000 MWh is wasted annually due to unavailability of any storage system. This wasted heat is approximately equivalent to the heating demand of 160 average Swedish single-family houses. 
This work aims to investigate different options allowing to use the waste heat as an energy source in neighbouring buildings and reduce the amount of purchased heating energy. The study initiates with the quantitative analysis of available waste heat and heating demand of nearby buildings. Based on this analysis, four options for the management and use of excess waste heat have been selected for detailed evaluation.
The first option considered in this work is to use a storage tank to provide the main building with heating during the furnace non-operating time. For this option, special attention has been paid to the tank sizing technique. The second option studied in detail in this work is to maximize the instantaneous use of waste heat by providing direct heating to nearby buildings. This implies the supply of waste heat directly to the buildings during the furnace operating time. In this context, a strategy has been developed to determine the optimal order for connecting different buildings depending on their demand profiles and distance from the furnace. In the third option, the instantaneous use of waste heat and hot water storage tanks has been studied simultaneously in various combinations. Finally, in the fourth option an underground thermal energy storage (UTES) system assisted by a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) has been considered for seasonal heat storage. The performance of the UTES and the GSHP system has been optimized by evaluating different strategies to maximise the source-side entering temperature to the heat pump.
All the above-mentioned options have been implemented in the building energy simulation program IDA ICE (Advanced level). For each option, the overall energy performance and corresponding energy savings have been evaluated. The economic feasibility of each option has been assessed and compared to other options based on life-cycle cost (LCCs) analysis. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of heat management between different buildings and underlines the importance of demands and availability analysis to determine the optimal solution.},

The use of solar thermal in connection with district heating is far behind (relatively only one tenth of) the use of solar thermal in individual houses - even though it is in most cases much cheaper to supply solar energy centrally to a district heating network, than to supply solar energy to individual houses. In Denmark right now “an explosion” in numbers of large scale solar district heating systems is seen. Not because of special subsidy schemes - but simply because the systems in many cases are competitive with gas and biomass based district heating systems. The main overall objective of the IEA-SHCi Task 45 is to assist in a strong and sustainable market development of large solar heating and cooling systems. The task will focus on the “MW-size” systems for district heating and cooling applications. The general outcome of the Task will be increased use of cost effective, well designed and well operated large scale solar thermal systems throughout the world - and a strong network of experts and professionals in the field.

Taking a building in Harbin as the object for simulation analysis, the operation effect and the change of the soil temperature field of the system were obtained. The results showed that: The average coefficient of performance (COP) of the MSHHPS with seasonal thermal storage was 3.06 (in the Harbin region for 10years), the soil thermal balance rate was 100.33% and the energy-saving rate was 29.84% comparing to the ground source heat pump system (GSHPS). For the initial investment, MSHHPS only required additional double-source heat pump unit, which accounted at 9.59%. The static payback period of the double-source heat pump unit was 4years.

This paper provides a rather simple but detailed methodology of including large solar heating systems in an existing district heating system, where heat is supplied by a large CHP plant. It uses hourly data of load and temperature patterns as well as radiation data and collector efficiency data to determine collector field size and storage size. The possibility of largely independent operation of sub-networks is analysed, which allows different system temperatures. It is demonstrated that a sub-network can operate without a back-up boiler and that both network parts benefit from the interaction."

To gain better understanding of both technical and economical scaling effects, the optimization was done separately for four cases with 50, 100, 200 and 500 buildings. The study was performed for Finnish conditions using dynamic TRNSYS simulations and optimized with a genetic algorithm, using the MOBO optimization tool. The modeled energy system had solar thermal collectors and solar electric panels for energy generation, two centralized short-term storage tanks and a seasonal borehole thermal energy storage system (BTES) for energy storage, and a ground source heat pump for additional heat generation. The larger communities provided noticeable cost-benefits when aiming for high performance. Larger seasonal storages allowed more direct utilization of seasonally stored heat, lowering the need for the heat pump and reducing electricity demand. Comparing the best and worst performing optimal energy system, annual demand for heating electricity was reduced by 80%. Renewable energy fractions close to 90% for heating were possible for all community sizes, but the large communities could obtain them with about 20% lower costs."

Injection of thermal energy into the borehole heat exchanger (BHE) or borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) before the heat extraction from BHE/BTES was favourable to the overall COP of system. It is very important to SAGSHPS to store sufficient solar thermal energy in the BTES because of its small spacing between boreholes. 32% of the electrical energy consumption in the HSGSHPS could be saved if the load circulation pump was turned off when no fan-coil was running, rather than always keeping it running at all times."

abstract = "A heat pump system is the ideal way to extend the heat supply of existing oil or gas fired heating system. Consumption costs are lowered through the use of free energy from the environment, and the dependence on fossils fuels simultaneously reduces. In order to investigate the performance of the solar-ground source heat pump system in the province of Erzurum having cold climate, an experimental set-up was constructed. The experimental apparatus consisted of solar collectors, a ground heat exchanger (GHE), a liquid-to-liquid vapor compression heat pump, water circulating pumps and other measurement equipments. In this study, the performance of the system was experimentally investigated. The experimental results were obtained from October to May of 2008–2009. The experimentally obtained results are used to calculate the heat pump coefficient of performance (COP) and the system performance (COPS). The coefficient of performance of the heat pump and system were found to be in the range of 3.0–3.4 and 2.7–3.0, respectively. This study also shows that this system could be used for residential heating in the province of Erzurum being a cold climate region of Turkey."

abstract = "This paper presents the numerical simulation of a solar assisted ground coupled heat pump (SAGCHP) system which can provide both space heating and domestic hot water (DHW). The optimization process is completed on the TRNSYS based platform by simulating the influence of solar collector area on the total borehole length and system performance. Simulations are also carried out under different meteorological conditions to explore the applicability of the proposed SAGCHP system in northern China. The simulating results show that the optimized system under the specified load conditions has a collector area of 40m2 and a borehole length of 264m. The annual total heat extraction plus 75% of the hot water requirement can be provided by solar energy in the optimized design. Furthermore, the energy balance of the optimized design is confirmed with a minor difference of 0.75%, and the system is proved more efficient and economical for its application in Beijing area."

abstract = "This paper presents the experimental study of a ground-coupled heat pump used in a 180m2 private residence and combined with thermal solar collectors. This process, called GEOSOL, meets domestic hot water and heating–cooling building energy needs. Solar heat is used as a priority for domestic hot water heating and when the preset water temperature is reached, excess solar energy is injected into the ground via boreholes. This system has the advantage to contribute to the balance of the ground loads, increasing the operating time of the solar collectors and preventing overheating problems. After 11 months in operation, the power extracted and injected into the ground had average values of 40.3 and 39.5W/m, respectively. Energy injected into the ground represents 34% of the heat extracted, and the heat pump's coefficient of performance (COP) in heating mode had an average value of 3.75. In addition, the domestic hot water solar fraction had an average value higher than 60% for the first 11 months in operation."

abstract = "Ground (or geothermal) heat exchangers are attracting a great deal of attention as a way of using shallow geothermal energy. This paper provides not only a critical review but also a thorough introduction to the analysis of heat transfer by borehole and foundation pile ground heat exchangers, with an emphasis on different analytical models. The literature is reviewed in a time-scale framework because of the diversity of the time and space scales involved in the thermal processes of ground heat exchangers. We summarize, discuss, and evaluate major advances in this field, including heat-source models, short-time models, models for energy piles, in situ thermal-response tests, indoor sandbox experiments, and parameter estimation as an inverse problem. Of particular note is that the unit-step temperature response (i.e., G-function) of a ground heat exchanger with one U-shaped pipe is calculated; and six analytical models are compared: an infinite cylinder-source model, two infinite line-source models, two finite line-source models, and a composite-medium line-source model. This paper closes by identifying several unsolved problems that require solutions."
